## **What is software engineering**

Software engineering consists in designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. This software should respond to the users’ needs and its development should follow good practices. The software application produced should improve quality, budget and time efficiency.

The software must be developed following some key principles :

- Dividing it into multiple components

- Share only necessary properties of each components with the others, and protect its data from external modifications

- Make the components reusable in different projects

- Continuously improve the software with maintenances adding new features, patching bugs and improving security

- Test the software functionalities and eventual bugs

- Follow agile methodology

- Keep the software up to date with all changes made and regularly deploys it in the production environment

## **Versioning tools**

Github and gitlab are very useful tools in software engineering since they provide git interfaces to the developers to share their code in a cloud-stored repository.

Git will allow you to work together on a project by using various commands. To avoid overwriting each other's changes, you need to create different branches for each issue you are working on, leaving a master branch for the main application to which we will merge other branches' changes. You need to be very careful when merging changes to keep them working along with the master.

To work on the project, you will need to create a new branch based on the current master, then clone the remote repository to a local one. Once you want to add your advancement to the remote branch, you will need to make your commits (with a clear message on the changes made) then push it to the remote branch. You can also fetch remote changes of your branch to your local repository.

By using this, you will be able to move forward together on your projects easily without stepping on each other’s toes.

We could also mention SVN, which, unlike git, requests the developer to be online since only the files they are working on are kept on local.

## **Collaborative Tools**

Software engineering collaboration tools are used to communicate while developing software. They are essential to manage sprints, assign tasks, collect feedback and discuss next steps of the project.

Among these collaboration tools, we could mention Trello, which uses Kanban boards, allowing the users to split the tasks in backlog, in progress, on hold or upcoming. We could also talk about Jira, with its Agile boards and sprint planning.

## **Communication tools**

Communication tools allow the users to efficiently manage the discussion topics while communicating about a project. Their channel system splits the different subjects which is really useful to easily retrieve information and also to hide from people certain unrelated topics. They can also manage virtual meetings or vocal channels.  For example, Teams and Discord are very popular communication tools.

## **Development environments**

Development environments are workspaces used to develop the source code for a software. They contain sets of processes and programming tools to ensure the code works well. They often integrate debugging tools that highlight parts of code producing errors in real time. Visual studio, for example, is a development environment for Windows.

A framework helps developers to be more efficient by providing a set of reusable components. It can be added to the development environments.

## **UML**

The Unified Modeling Language is a visual language that aims at schematizing a software system. It provides and formalizes many types of diagrams which can be roughly divided into three main groups: behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams. These diagrams will help non-developers users to understand a software structure easily.
