## How to make changes

- Clone the project: `git pull <repo url>`
- Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b 'feature/<name of your feature>'`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m '<Tell us what you did and why here>'`
- Push you changes: `git push`
- Open a PR on github


## How to solve merge conflicts

Prefer git rebases over merges

Note: When done rebasing, you have to push using `git push --force`
